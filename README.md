# BlueSaab (SAAB-CDC)
BlueSaab is a Bluetooth Aux Input device compatible with some Saab cars between 1998 and 2005. 

This device allows connection via Bluetooth to stream music to the audio system with superior audio quality. Since BlueSaab uses the signal path originally intended for the CD changer it is possible to achieve a high quality audio transmission. 

## Features
